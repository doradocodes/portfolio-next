                    <p>
                        E-ink has always been a really interesting and exciting technology for me, ever since I saw a
                        Kindle for the first time. The matte quality really captured the essence of paper, which was so
                        different from all other kinds of devices at the time. It took me a long time before I was able
                        to have enough money to acquire my own Kindle, and I was obsessed with it. From my original
                        thesis project, my intention with the camera was to replicate the experience of using a film
                        camera, much like e-ink displays attempt to replicate the experience of paper. Therefore, I
                        think it would be interesting to combine the two-—a digital camera that can replicate the
                        experience of shooting with a instant camera. The device would take pictures using the Raspberry
                        Pi camera and display it on the e-ink display. The picture would (likely) stay on the screen
                        until the next image is captured, giving you both a sense of excitement of seeing a photo
                        instantly, but then gives the bittersweet feeling when you realize that you would never see the photo again. Or, perhaps, the images could be stored in the device and you could view those previous images,
                        but only on that device. The idea would be that the photos taken on the camera could only live
                        in the camera and nowhere else, becoming a kind of time capsule.

                            The camera is built using a Raspberry Pi Zero W, a Raspberry Pi camera module, and a 2.13 inch Waveshare e-ink display. It is housed in a 3D printed case that is designed to mimic the look and feel of a Polaroid camera. The camera is powered by a 1200mAh LiPo battery, which is charged via a micro USB port. The Python script runs as soon as the Pi is powered on. It is controlled using a single button, which is used to take photos.
                            Once the image is captured, the image takes a few seconds to appear (or "develop") and is displayed on the screen for 7 seconds before it disappears. The intention is to invoke a sense of anticipation and nostalgia, the prior being the excitement of seeing a photo develop, and the latter being the bittersweet feeling of knowing that the photo will disappear.

                content: <div>
                    <p>This project originated from my desire to merge two significant aspects of my life: analog
                        photography and software development. Additionally, I aimed to critically examine and enhance
                        the role of social media in sharing photography work. As an online photographer, particularly on
                        platforms like Instagram, I have experienced frustration and discouragement due to the
                        competitive nature of social media algorithms.</p>
                    <p>During the research phase, I broke down the aspects of photography into three parts:
                        photograph-making, photograph-sharing, and photograph-consuming. I explored each of these areas
                        by reading books, prototyping ideas, and reflecting on my own experiences.</p>
                    <p>In the photograph-making phase of my research, I read books from the Ansel Adams Photography
                        Photography Series, which includes The Camera, The Negative, and The Print. Published in the
                        1950s, each book of the series is a deep dive into the technical aspects of analog photography.
                        The descriptions and diagrams from these books helped me envision the mechanics of an analog
                        camera, and gave me ideas on how to incorporate them into my design.</p>
                    <p>In the photograph-sharing phase of my research, I turned to "The Social Photo" by Nathan
                        Jurgenson. Jurgenson's thought-provoking insights shed light on the impact of social media on
                        our understanding and engagement with photography. He delves into topics such as the
                        transformation of images into data, the rise of the "selfie," and the construction of identity
                        in the digital age. Drawing from Jurgenson's perspectives, I critically examined the role of
                        social media platforms, particularly Instagram, in shaping the perception and value of
                        photographic work. His work inspired me to challenge the constraints of algorithmic validation
                        and explore alternative modes of sharing and experiencing photography. A particular quote that
                        resonated with me was, “In the age of digital abundance, photography desperately needs this
                        introduction of intentional and assured morality, so that some photos can become immortal
                        again.”</p>
                    <p>During the photograph-consuming phase of my research, I ventured beyond theoretical readings and
                        engaged in practical exploration. I examined online photography communities, and analyzed the
                        behavior and preferences of social media users. This immersive approach enabled me to gain a
                        nuanced understanding of the ways in which individuals engage with and derive meaning from
                        photographs in the digital realm.</p>
                    <p>Based on my research and personal insights, I set out to create a camera that combines the charm
                        of analog photography with modern digital features. Taking inspiration from the wisdom of Ansel
                        Adams and the thought-provoking ideas of Nathan Jurgenson, I aimed to design a tool that helps
                        people connect more deeply with the art of photography and breaks away from the usual ways of
                        sharing images online.</p>
                    <p>By incorporating the workings of analog cameras into my design, I aimed to provide photographers
                        with a hands-on and immersive experience. At the same time, I ventured into fresh approaches for
                        sharing my work online, steering away from the controlled and algorithm-dependent nature of
                        mainstream platforms. Drawing inspiration from Jurgenson's insights on social media and the
                        formation of identity, I envisioned a digital realm that embraces genuineness and fosters deeper
                        connections with photography.</p>

                    <p>This project provided an invaluable opportunity for me to acquire new skill sets that I had long
                        desired to learn. It began with sketching and constructing an initial cardboard prototype to
                        verify the technical feasibility of the waist-level viewfinder mechanics. Progressing further, I
                        utilized a laser cutter to craft a refined prototype with an acrylic body. I delved into working
                        with a Raspberry Pi, gaining proficiency in flashing an OS on an SD card and scripting in Python
                        to facilitate image capture with a Raspberry Pi camera module. By the culmination of the spring
                        semester, I had a fully functional prototype that enabled outdoor shooting.</p>
                    <p>During the subsequent summer term, my primary focus revolved around mastering the art of 3D
                        printing to create a more polished camera body. I used Fusion 360 to create precise 3D models,
                        which I materialized using a 3D printer. Upon the completion of the 3D printed prototype, I
                        proceeded to construct a server that uploaded images directly to my dedicated website. Utilizing
                        HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I built the website and incorporated the Greensock animation
                        library.</p>

                    <p>This project represents a deeply personal exploration that intertwines the realms of analog
                        photography and software development. It has allowed me to challenge the limitations imposed by
                        social media and algorithmic validation, encouraging a more authentic and meaningful engagement
                        with photography. By fusing the tactile charm of analog photography with discreet digital
                        integration, I have sought to bridge the gap between past and present, tradition and
                        innovation.</p>

                    <p>Throughout this journey, I have ventured into uncharted territories, acquiring new skills in
                        prototyping, 3D printing, and programming. The process has been one of growth, as I delved into
                        the technical aspects of camera mechanics, expanded my knowledge of photography theory, and
                        explored the psychology of sharing work on social media.</p>

                    <p>Moreover, this project has fostered a deeper understanding of the multifaceted nature of passions
                        and the boundless possibilities that emerge when we break free from predefined boundaries. It
                        serves as a testament to the power of embracing our diverse interests and uncovering new avenues
                        for creative expression.</p>

                    <p>As I embark on the next phase of this project, I look forward to further refining my camera
                        design, experimenting with different techniques, and continuing to challenge the conventions of
                        digital photography. Ultimately, my goal is to inspire others to explore their own passions,
                        break down barriers, and find unique ways to express themselves creatively in an ever-evolving
                        digital landscape.</p>

                    <p>This project is a testament to the transformative potential of embracing our passions, blurring
                        boundaries, and forging new paths of artistic exploration. It is a reminder that our journey of
                        self-discovery and creative expression is an ongoing process, one that continues to unfold with
                        each new endeavor.</p>

                        began at the beginning of the
                        summer session. I already had previous coding experience, so my Creative Coding instructor,
                        Carrie, told
                        me to follow my own curriculum. She encouraged me to experiment with anything I have been
                        previously
                        curious about, so I told her I wanted to learn and experiment more with 3D web graphics
                        (Three.js) and
                        the idea of art installations. At the time, some ideas I had about my final project included
                        visualizing
                        music and placing in an art installation.</p>
                    <p className="smaller-font">During the first week of classes, I followed some ThreeJS tutorials
                        which taught
                        me the basics of creating objects, manipulating cameras, and shading. For the first creative
                        coding
                        assignment, “Opposites”, I created a 3D object with alternated turning into a sun or moon.</p>

                        <img src="/assets/ambient_watercolor_2.png" alt="2" className="image"/>
                    </div>
                    <p className="smaller-font">While I was experimenting with Three.js in Creative Coding, I was also
                        participating in group exercises in Interface Lab. For one of the exercises, we were tasked with
                        analyzing an existing technological interface. My group chose something simple–the mouse and
                        keyboard.
                        The mouse and keyboard has been so heavily integrating into our society that we have overlooked
                        all the
                        issues that come with it. Mainly, how it can cause pain for a lot of people after long term use.
                        This,
                        along with playing with the OrbitControls camera in Three.js, I began to toy with the idea of
                        being able
                        to manipulate objects on the screen with just your hand gestures.</p>
                    <p className="smaller-font">To do so, I knew that the webcam would be the easiest and most
                        assessable way to
                        recognize and track hand gestures. Carrie had suggested I looked into ML5, a machine learning
                        javascript
                        library, to recognize hand gestures through my webcam. I eventually went down a rabbit hole,
                        trying to
                        train my own model to recognize the specific gestures I wanted since prebuilt models, like
                        PoseNet, did
                        not do exactly what I wanted. In the interest of time, I abandoned my attempt to train my own
                        model and
                        instead modified the design of my intended user interaction to fit with PoseNet/HandPose.</p>
                    <p className="smaller-font">After being able to import the HandPose library, I modified my original
                        “Opposites” assignment to be a globe. The idea was to be able to rotate the globe horizontally
                        and
                        vertically by moving your hand to the right or left, and to control zoom with two hands (opened
                        to zoom
                        out, closed to zoom in).</p>
                    <img src="/assets/ambient-watercolor-3.gif" alt="3" className="image"/>
                    <p>
                        While the rotation effect was cool, the purpose of the project felt aimless, and I felt stumped
                        with what to do with it. Putting this idea on hold, I began researching about other topics that
                        I was interested in, which included generative art. I had seen a tutorial about simulating
                        watercolor digitally and using the concept of recursion to form the realistic randomness of
                        analog art. I prototyped the idea in P5 and began to think of ways of bringing the ideas from
                        the tutorial into animation. With animation, I thought of ways that would allow users to
                        interact with generative watercolor art.
                    </p>
                    <img src="/assets/ambient-watercolor-4.gif" alt="4" className="image"/>
                    <p>We began learning about serial input and output in Interface Lab, and I like the idea of having a
                        physical controller to interact with the watercolor sketch. The original idea for the
                        interaction was to use potentiometers to control the paintbrush. However, after feedback from
                        David, the use of potentiometers can be a cumbersome user experience, and I began to brainstorm
                        different way of interaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With my learnings from both ml5 and generative art, I ultimately decided to build my final
                        project as a combination of the two. The goal was to give users a calming and tranquil
                        experience playing with digital watercolor. I wanted to allow users to paint with the watercolor
                        brush using hand gestures, but be able to control the brush color with a physical control panel.
                        I wanted to have three potentiometers to represent the red, green, and blue values of the
                        brush’s color.
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>I began building the control panel by laser cutting the design on cardboard. I wanted to see if
                        the board would stand up at an angle, so that the slanted surface will feel comfortable for the
                        user. After seeing how it would stand with cardboard, I cut a piece of acrylic, and began wiring
                        the breadboard to hook up the potentiometers. While I was adding the potentiometers, my
                        classmate, Ai, suggested that I added LEDs to bring more visuals to the panel. Excited about the
                        idea, I cut another piece of acrylic with holes for the LEDs.</p>
                    <img src="/assets/ambient-watercolor-7.jpeg" alt="7" className="image"/>
                    <p>This is the final result of the control panel (without the LEDs wired up). Ultimately I was
                        satisfied with the simple, color coordinated user interface. Wiring the LEDs was the tricky
                        part, because soldering wires to connect the LEDs that were superglued underneath the panel was
                        difficult.</p>
                    <img src="/assets/ambient-watercolor-8.jpeg" alt="8" className="image"/>
                    <p>As a final piece to this project, I added sound to put the user in the desired calm and tranquil
                        headspace. I recorded some ambient sound notes on Garageband and added the sound every time a
                        new brush stroke started on the screen. </p>

                    The <i>Golden Hour Clock</i> began as a project to explore the concept of time. I was interested in
                    the idea of time being a human construct, and how we perceive time. I wanted to create a clock that
                    would display time in a way that was not numerical, but rather, in a way that was more natural and
                    intuitive. I was inspired by the idea of the golden hour, a period shortly after sunrise or before
                    sunset during which daylight is redder and softer than when the Sun is higher in the sky. I wanted
                    to create a clock that would display time using colors, and the colors would change depending on the
                    time of day. After the sun set, the clock would display partially in a dark blue color, depending on
                    the phase of the moon.

                    <p>I began ideating the clock through sketching. I wanted the clock to have a minimalist shape that
                        had LEDs behind it, bouncing the light against the wall it hung on. I wanted a soft, ambient
                        light that felt pleasing to look at.</p>

                    the art of creating everyday. Before starting this challenge, I had little to no experience with
                    Blender or any kind of 3D rendering. As an attempt to maintain consistency for this challenge, I
                    picked this isometric, polymer clay-like style for all 50 days. As the days progressed, I began to
                    realize how much joy each render brought me as I experimented with different techniques each day. I
                    also began to realize how much I enjoyed the process of creating, and how much I wanted to continue
                    to create everyday. Not only was I able to learn a new skill, I learned how consistency and practice
                    can lead to improvement and growth.

                This project began as a collaboration with Elizabeth Engelman. We had previously spoken about creating
                an online yearbook as a place to share our class memories. There were so many pictures and videos over
                our exciting summer term that we felt it would be great to have them in one place. We saw how
                collaborative apps like Figma and Miro were key to collaboration, especially in a time of remote work,
                and we wanted to create a similar experience for our yearbook. We wanted to create a space where we
                could all share our memories and see each other's contributions.

                <p>
                    We wanted the yearbook to look and feel like a book, but wanted to take advantage of the digital
                    medium by incorporating moving elements, like videos and gifs. We thought about how other platforms,
                    like Miro and Figma, used sockets to allow realtime collaboration and we wanted to use the same
                    method. However, we didn’t want it to feel like a design tool, so we contained the collaboration to
                    the pages of the book. We wanted to add features that allowed users to add text and stickers to the
                    pages, but kept the author of those elements anonymous to replicate how a physical yearbook would be
                    signed.

                We used <a target="_blank" href="http://socket.io/">Socket.io</a> to integrate the realtime
                collaboration. For the class
                photo gifs, Liz found the <a target="_blank"
                                             href="https://yahoo.github.io/gifshot/">Gifshot</a> library, which is an
                open-source library that uses your webcam to create gifs. For the book view, we used a library called <a
                href="http://www.turnjs.com/">TurnJs</a>, another open-source library, which turns a block of html and
                automatically puts it in a flippable book view. I imported jQuery to be able to use TurnJs, so Liz and I
                took advantage of it and used the library for all of our click events.
